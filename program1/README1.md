## (Name): Yafet Kubrom (EUID):11334602

Program 1 has two parts. Part A implements merge sort using C++.
Part B combines merge sort with insertion sort. it implements merge sort until (High - low <= 8), then use insertion sort.

## Assumption

* `data1.txt` must exist in directory.
* `data1.txt` must have 500 or less numbers in one line.
* `out1.txt` is optional. The program will create one if one does not exist.

## Compile & Execute

Part A

* Compile using `g++ -o program1A program1A.cpp`
* Execute using `./program1A`

Part B

* Compile using `g++ -o program1B program1B.cpp`
* Execute using `./program1B`
