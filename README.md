# CSCE 3110 (Data Structures and Algorithms, SP2020)

This course explored non-linear data structures (ex. tree, graph) and elementary graph algorithms. The lecture emphasized on the theoretical aspects while the following programming assignments covered the implementation using C++. Covered topics were Sorting algorithms, graph theory and minimum spanning tree.

## Programs

1. Program 1 - Merge sort with insertion sort
2. Program 2 - Breadth First Search(BFS)
3. program 3 - Heap Sort
4. program 4 - Prim's Algorithm
