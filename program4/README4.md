
# PROGRAM 4: PRIM'S ALGORITHM

This program implements the O(n^2) version of Prim's algorighm using C++. It will take input from a file that consist of matrix (of 50 or less vertices).
The output will be list of edges of minimum spanning tree (MST) and total cost.

## Assumption

* `data4.txt` must exist in directory.
* `data4.txt` must have 50 or less numbers of vertices.
* `output4.txt` is optional. The program will create one if one does not exist.

## Compile & Execute

* Compile using `g++ -o program4 program4.cpp`
* Execute using `./program4`
* open `output4.txt` for output.
